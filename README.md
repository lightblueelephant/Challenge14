**Package Requirements and Versions: pip install x versions -python --pathlib --hvplot --matplotlib --sklearn

Purpose The purpose of this notebook is to create a machine learning algorithm that can adapt to new data so that the firm can improve its existing algorithmic trading systems.

steps

    Establish performance baseline
    Fine Tune the baseline trading algorithm
    Evaluate a new machine learning classifier
    creation of an evaluation report

Files Needed machine_learning_trading_bot.ipynb (notebook containing code) 
emerging_markets_ohlcv.csv (raw data) 
LogisticRegression.png (png image of graph showing actual vs strategy returns)

Evaluation Report:

As seen in the graph (saved as LogisticRegression.png), the strategy returns were performing better than the actual returns until 2021 when strategy returns dropped below the actual returns. Overall the Logistic Regression model performed about the same as the SVM model (20_month_train.png)
